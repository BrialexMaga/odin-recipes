# odin-recipes

This is a simple page who contains 3 recipes.
What I assume was the point of this work was to demonstrate that I understand HTML, I can distinguish what tags should I use and what attributes should I use too.
Of course, maintaining what has been learned before, I created all my files using Bash command line.
Create directories, files, copy them to save time was what I did.

This was way to easy, and I should be aiming for harder challenges.
